	Machines take advantage of the particularity of each person’s appearance to flatten out our collective individuality. 

	A smile is intentional and might indeed indicate happiness, just as a furrowed brow might be proof of a melancholic temperament. But we also know that emotion is fleeting and can be faked. We thus shouldn’t really trust whatever it is a photographic portrait seems to be telling us. A portrait is an open door. It can remind us of our ethical duty to the other. Unlike machines, we see with sympathy.

	Similarly, a book acted as a sort of protective barrier, as well as a bridge between us and its subject matter. Because it parceled up the thoughts and experiences of someone writing 15 years before and 5,000 miles away, it shielded us from the immediate situation. In reading it, we are not obliged to enter into a discussion or take action as we might have done on social media; we could simply imagine and think. 

	One of the most exciting findings to emerge from neuroscience in recent years underlines the brain’s inherently social nature. Neuroscientists have looked more closely at what the brain does during non-active moments, when we’re chilling out and the brain is at rest. Every time we are not engaged in an active task the brain falls into a neural configuration called the “default network.” The default network directs us to think about other people’s minds—their thoughts, feelings, and goals. Whenever it has a free moment, the human brain has an automatic reflex to go social.

	But over the last fifty years, while society has been growing more and more prosperous and individualistic, our social connections have been dissolving. We volunteer less. We entertain guests at our homes less. We are getting married less. We are having fewer children. And we have fewer and fewer close friends with whom we’d share the intimate details of our lives. We are increasingly denying our social nature, and paying a price for it. Over the same period of time that social isolation has increased, our levels of happiness have gone down, while rates of suicide and depression have multiplied.
 
	Surveillance is nothing new, but with storage getting cheaper and analytical tools more ferocious, a dystopian future is closer than it has ever been. Automation is playing an outsize role in the creation and dissemination of photographic portraits. Machines are making images of people for other machines to see and analyze. We are photographed when we cross international borders. Cameras in public places scan and collect the faces of passers-by. We rouse our mobile phones with our faces. Even the cameras on our computers cannot be trusted not to spy on us. Our faces are spirited away in the name of societal stability, crime prevention, corporate profit or national security.

	Social connections are as important to our survival and flourishing as the need for food, safety, and shelter.
